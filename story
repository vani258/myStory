Once anon a time there was a tortoise and rabbit 
So he challenges the tortoise for a race
They both start the race and whoever reaches the finish line first will win
Rabbit takes a small nap under the tree as he was confident that he will win the race
Tortoise reaches near rabbit 
And at last he reaches the final position
